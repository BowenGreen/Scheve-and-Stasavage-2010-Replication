# Scheve-and-Stasavage-2010-Replication
This is a quick reproduction i conducted for one of my advanced linear models classes in graduate school.

Replication files for Kenneth Scheve and David Stasavage's (2010), "The Conscription of Wealth: Mass Warfare and the Demand for Progressive Taxation," International Organization 64(4): 529–61.

Scheve and Stasavage’s (2010) seminal paper, The Conscription of Wealth: Mass Warfare and the Demand for Progressive Taxation, argued that
“mobilization for mass warfare led to demands for increased taxation of the wealthy to more fairly distribute the burden for the war effort” (Scheve & Stasavage, 2010). I first replicate the main findings of Scheve and Stasavage (2010), being, Table (1) and Table (3). I find that the arguments of Scheve and Stasavage (2010) hold up well under reproduction, with the authors correctly estimating the influences of war mobilization on taxation, with their findings robust to alternative specifications and consistent with their data and research design.
